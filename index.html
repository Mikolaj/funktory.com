<h1>Ƒ:υηκτοɤγ</h1>

<p>

Functory is a start-up company in stealth mode founded by
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolajkonarski">
Mikolaj Konarski</a>.

<p>

During breaks in plotting world domination, we do indie game development <br>
and experiment with the feedback loop
between procedural content generation <br>
(including content-driven AI) and player input
(data-mined play-style, level ratings,  <br>
in-game created content).

<p>

We are available for contract and consulting work concerning any problems <br>
that are caused by or can be solved with software.
We strongly prefer Haskell and OCaml <br>
for the programming part of the work, if there is any.
The more difficult <br>
and mission-critical the problem,
the higher the chance we are your best bet up to, <br>
but not including, impossible assignments,
which we try to reject early.

<p>

We welcome your inquiries at <br>
<EM>mikolaj.konarski@funktory.com</EM>
